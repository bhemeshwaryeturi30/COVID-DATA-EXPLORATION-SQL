# COVID-DATA-EXPLORATION-SQL

This SQL project delves into COVID-19 data, utilizing a range of SQL techniques including Joins, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), Temp Tables, Window Functions, Aggregate Functions, and View Creation. The analysis encompasses various perspectives, from tracking infection rates to vaccination progress across different locations and timeframes. Notable queries include examining the likelihood of death upon contracting COVID-19, assessing infection rates relative to population size, and identifying countries and continents with the highest death counts and vaccination rates. Additionally, the script demonstrates the use of CTEs, Temp Tables, and Views for efficient data manipulation and visualization preparation.
